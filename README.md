I genuinely enjoying creating this game. It was pretty cool to create something using code that I would never be able to do before taking this class. I did find difculity in finding the right functions to have the game running smoothly. But with enough research and looking through the textbook thoroughly, I was able to complete it. Overall this was a really cool and fun assignment.

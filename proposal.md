# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Unfamiliar Forest

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This a choose your own adventure game which gives you different options that will give you different results.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will give you two options each time your are prompted with a question or decision. Each option results in a different outcome. The print function will give it more of a "realistic" game feel. It will tell a story and ask questions that prompt the user to enter in a choice using the input function. The time sleep is presented after a majority of the sentances. It will serve as a paise between those sentances.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish learning a new skill.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I will grasp a better understanding of all these functions by the end of this project. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to complete the entire project by the deadline.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I would have to learn how to use variables, make judgments using if-statements, receive input from the user, and write loops. I would need to get more comfortable working with strings and look into using time-related methods to pause the game. Additionally, I would have to keep in mind to divide the game into smaller chunks and refer back to the textbook and tutorials for better intrsuctions.
